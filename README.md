## Architecture

VIPER is an architectural pattern widely used in iOS app development to organize application modules in a logical manner and reduce dependencies between them.

VIPER consists of five main components:
- View: Represents the user interface and detects user interactions.
- Interactor: Executes the business logic of the application and manages data.
- Presenter: Prepares and formats data to be presented by the View.
- Entity: Represents data models.
- Router: Handles navigation between modules.
VIPER promotes a structure where each component has a specific responsibility and communicates tightly with others. This approach helps in building modular and manageable codebases, even for large-scale projects.
